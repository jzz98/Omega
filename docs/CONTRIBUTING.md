Contributing
============

Thanks for considering contributing to this project. The repository is small and straightforward — follow these guidelines to help keep contributions clean.

Getting started
---------------
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Run `npm install` to get dependencies.
3. Run any example scripts to validate behavior (see `docs/USAGE.md`).

Coding style
------------
- Keep changes focused and minimal.
- Follow existing file style (Esmodules modules, concise helpers).

Committing
---------
- Use clear commit messages.
- One logical change per commit when possible.

Submitting PRs
--------------
- Open a PR against `main` with a brief description of the change and reason.
- Link to relevant issue (if any) or give reproduction steps.

Tests
-----
There are no automated tests in the repository by default. Add tests in a `/test` folder when adding features that require verification.

Contact
-------
Open issues or PRs on the repository. If you want, I can help add CI/test scaffolding.
